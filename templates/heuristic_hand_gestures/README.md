# Heuristic Hand Gestures

This template enables the heuristic gesture recognizer and simply logs gesture
`start`/`end` events to the console for each hand. Use it to validate pinch,
open-palm, fist, thumbs-up, point, and spread detections on devices like Quest
or in the simulator.

For gesture configuration details, see https://xrblocks.github.io/docs/manual/HandGestures/.
