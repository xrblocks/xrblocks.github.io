# XR Blocks Sample: Gemini Live AI

Real-time AI conversation with camera and audio streaming in XR.

## Features

- Click the text button to start/stop Gemini Live
- Camera feed sent to AI every second
- Live audio streaming and transcription
- Floating UI panel with conversation history

## Setup

This is only for demonstration and prototyping purposes:

1. Add your Gemini API key apending like `<website-domain>/templates/7_ai_live/?key=AIxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`,
   or put it in a JSON file `keys.json` with
   `{"gemini": {"apiKey": "AIxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"}}`

2. Open in browser and click the text button to start

## Keep your API keys safe

Never commit API keys to source control. Do not check your API key into version
control systems like Git.

Never expose API keys on the client-side. Do not use your API key directly in
web or mobile apps in production. Keys in client-side code
(including our JavaScript/TypeScript libraries and REST calls) can be extracted.
