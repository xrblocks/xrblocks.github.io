# Heuristic Gesture HUD

This sample enables the heuristic gesture recognizer and shows a simple HUD that
displays the most confident gesture per hand while logging gesture start/end
events to the console. Use it to validate pinch, open-palm, fist, thumbs-up,
point, and spread detections in the simulator or on device.

Run `npm run serve` (or your preferred static server) and open
`samples/gestures_heuristic/` in a WebXR-capable browser.
