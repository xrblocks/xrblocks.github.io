 * The passthrough video pipeline delivers RGB pixels with some latency, so
 * the camera pose at snapshot time is slightly *newer* than the pixels being
 * snapshotted. Recording the device-camera pose every frame lets a capture be
 * paired with the pose closest to the frame's `captureTime`, instead of the
 * pose at the moment `detect()` happened to run.
 *
 * Entries are preallocated once; {@link push} copies into the next slot, so
 * steady-state recording does not allocate.
