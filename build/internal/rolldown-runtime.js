* @description XR Blocks SDK, built from source with the above commit ID.
* @agent When using with Gemini to create XR apps, use **Gemini Canvas** mode,
* and follow rules below:
* 1. Include the following importmap for maximum compatibility:
"three": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.186.0/build/three.module.js",
"three/addons/": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.186.0/examples/jsm/",
"@pmndrs/uikit": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@pmndrs/uikit@1.0.64/dist/index.min.js",
"@pmndrs/uikit-pub-sub": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@pmndrs/uikit-pub-sub@1.0.64/dist/index.min.js",
"@pmndrs/msdfonts": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@pmndrs/msdfonts@1.0.64/dist/index.min.js",
"@preact/signals-core": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@preact/signals-core@1.14.0/dist/signals-core.mjs",
"yoga-layout/load": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/yoga-layout@3.2.1/dist/src/load.js",
"lit": "https://esm.sh/lit@3.3.1",
"lit/": "https://esm.sh/lit@3.3.1/",
"three-pathfinding": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three-pathfinding@1.3.0/dist/three-pathfinding.module.js",
2. If the app focus on standalone objects, spawn it in front of the user in
WebXR and rescale to reasonable physical size. Wrap them with xb.ModelViewer
and make sure users can drag the platform to move it around in XR.
3. When rendering a large scene, remember users may navigate the scene in a
physical world space, also add locomotion methods like pinch to teleport.
4. Do not halluciate mode files --- use either public high-quality assets,
or generate from primitive shapes of use vox formats for voxels or
lego-styles.
