Repository for the main XR Blocks landing page: https://xrblocks.github.io/.

## Deployment
The landing page is hosted using Github Pages from the `build` branch. Commits to this branch are automatically generated by the `Create build branch` Github action.

When commiting to this repository, the workflow will be triggered automatically to update the site.
For XR Blocks authors, this action can be manually launched by selecting "Run Workflow" from [the actions tab](https://github.com/xrblocks/xrblocks.github.io/actions/workflows/build.yml).

When run, the action will perform the following:
1. Clone [google/xrblocks](https://github.com/google/xrblocks).
2. Build the library as well as docs.
3. Copy the generated `docs` and generated `build` into the `build` folder.
4. Copy `samples`, `demos`, and `templates` into the `build` folder.
5. Commit the contents of the `build` folder to the `build` branch.
